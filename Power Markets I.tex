\fstitle{Power Markets I}
\section{Pan-European POwer Market and its Liberalization} 

\subsection*{Cross Border Trading} 

Total Transfer Capacity (TTC) = Long Term Contracts (LTC) + Availible transfer Capacity (ATC) + Emergency Exchange Margings + Uncertainty

\subsection*{SWEP} Swiss Electricity Price Index
\begin{itemize}
	\item at $220 \si{\kilo \volt}$ / $380 \si{\kilo \volt}$ level
	\item only spot market
	\item synthetic price for "peak hour" (11-12)
\end{itemize}

\section{Electricity Spot Market}
\subsection*{EEX}
Products:
\begin{itemize}
 	\item Single hours
 	\item Base load (24h)
 	\item Peak load (8-20 h)
 \end{itemize} 

 MCP: Market Clearing Price

 The price is determined by matching the supply and demand curve

 \section{Price formation} 

 \textbf{Supply} 
 The market price is determined by the marginal costs of the power plant (variable production costs)
 $\Ra$ Merit order 

 \textbf{Demand}
 The demand of end-customers is almost inelastic 

 \textbf{Influence factors} 
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Weather (wind, solar, nuclear, hydro, heating)
 	\item Outages (planned / unplanned)
 	\item Congestion (cross-border)
 	\item Different variable costs
 	\item Seasonality
 \end{itemize}

\section{Portfolio Managment (1)} 

\subsection*{Physical position}
\begin{itemize}
 	\item production (planned, optimized )
 	\item sales to (end) consumers, fully supply contracts
 	\item sales contracts with phy. delivery
 	\item purchase contracts with phy. delivery
 \end{itemize}

 Net physical posistion: long (too much energy) or short (too little energy)

 Balancing with production (PP output), bilateral trading or trading at the exchange

 Deviations are compensated by the supply of balancing power
\section{Introduction to Energy Economics}

\subsection*{Requirements}

  	\item regulator: ElCom
  \end{itemize} 
\section{Futures Contracts}

\subsection*{Forward}
Agreeement on the purchase or sale of a good, the "underlying"

\subsection*{Future}
\begin{itemize}
  	\item standardized product
  	\item traded on the futures market of an exchange
  	\item daily adjustment to price movements ("marking-to market")
  \end{itemize}  

 \subsection*{Long- and Short position}
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Long position
 	\begin{itemize}
 		\item physically: energy producer
 		\item contractually: compelled to purchase the good
 	\end{itemize}
 	\item Short position
 	 \begin{itemize}
 		\item physically: energy consumer
 		\item contractually: compelled to deliver the good
 	\end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}

 \subsection*{EEX Future market}

\subsubsection*{Standardized future contracts}

 \textbf{Underlying}: Phelix Base, Phelix Peak (Mo-Fr, 8-20)

 \textbf{Delivery period}:\\
 monthly: current month + 6 following \\
 quarterly: following 7 quarters \\
 yearly: following 6 years

 \textbf{Unit} $1 \si{\mega \watt}$ 

 \subsection*{Properties} 
 Contract trading: delivery at a future date, price reflects expectation

 Price drivers: growth of the spot market, economic data

 Volumes: big (yearly quantities)

 Volatility: low

 \subsubsection*{Cascading}
 Contracts are automatically replaced with the next-shortest term contracts.

 Motivation: avoiding high price fluctuation due to low liquidity

 \subsubsection*{Settlement}
 monthly contracts are fullfilled financially  

 settelment price is average of Phelix Base or Peak

 \subsubsection*{Motivation}

 \begin{itemize}
  	\item hedging price risk
  	\item organized trading
  	\item liquity
  	\item anonymity
  	\item transperency
  	\item no counterparty risk
  	\item Disadvantage: fees, IT infrastructure
  \end{itemize} 

\section{Cross-Border Trading}

Clearing price of the region is at where supply and demand match. Imported power moves the supply curve to the right.

\subsection{Capacity constraints}
Limited capacities $\ra$ complete leveling not possible

Capacity can be bought on annual, monthly and daily basis.
\begin{itemize}
	\item sold in auctions (implicit, explicit)
	\item seperatly in every direction
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implicit Auctions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item prior and independent of spot market
	\item offers optionalities
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Explicit Auctions}  
\begin{itemize}
	\item simultaneous clearing of capacity rights and spot trading
	\item optimal allocation
	\item reduced potential for 'capacity hoarding'
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Market coupling}
In case of capacity constraints (ATC too small) capacity has value and therefore prices do only partially converge. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item decoupling of markets
	\item congestion revenue (must be invested by the TSO in grid extensions)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Flow-based Market Coupling}
\begin{itemize}
 	\item expected cross-border flows (network simulation)
 	\item allocation of cpapcities between regions due to market behaviour
 	\item ATC and NTC represent existing/installed capacity but not how they are in different market situations
 	\item applies the expected used capacity to the price coupling mechanism
 \end{itemize} 

\subsection{Availible capacity}
TTC: Total transfer capacity

TRM: Transfer reliablity margin

NTC: Net transfer capacity

ATC: Availible transfer capacity (NTC - notified priority contracts

\subsection{Daily sequence}

\begin{itemize}
 	\item (explicit) capacity auctions
 	\item SwissIX bidding
 	\item F/DE-AT bidding
 	\item nomination of capacity
 	\item non-nominated capacity is reused (blocking strictly forbidden)
 \end{itemize} 
\section{Ancillary Services}


\subsection{Primary control (R1)}
(Pumped-) hydro, run-of-river (limited)

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\pm 3000 \si{\mega \watt}$ in the ENTSO-E area ($\pm 71 \si{\mega \watt}$ in CH)

\subsection{SDL Services}
\begin{itemize}
 	\item ancillary services vital for system stability
 	\item roughly $\pm 1000 \si{\mega \watt}$ regulation in CH
 	\item fundamental value of ancillary services is prevention of a system blackout
 \end{itemize} 
\section{Balance groups and balance energy}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1 control area: swissgrid
	\item blance group: aggregation of infeed/outtakes
	\item balance energy: difference between set and actual
	\item balance energy is provided by regulating power plants
	\item schedules are always fulfilled
	\item costs/income from unscheduled exchanges always disadvantageous
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Price machanism for balance energy}

BG short:

stabilizing: $(P_{\ir{spot}} + 10 \text{Eur/MWh}) \cdot 1.1$

destabilizing: $(P_{\ir{reg}} + 10 \text{Eur/MWh}) \cdot 1.1$

BG long:

stabilizing: $(P_{\ir{spot}} - 5 \text{Eur/MWh}) \cdot 0.9$

destabilizing: $(P_{\ir{reg}} - 5 \text{Eur/MWh}) \cdot 0.9$
\section{Risk managment (1)}

\subsection{Mark to Market} 

Difference between strategy outcome and the spot market price

\subsection{Price Modelling}
Prices can be modelled as a a stochastic process:

$\Delta x = a \cdot \Delta t + b \cdot \Delta \tilde z$

\section{Contract valuation with an Hourly Price Forward Curve (HPFC)}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Historic relation of hourly spot prices is used to transform the standard products base and peak into a synthetic hourly price curve
	\item Hourly price (forward) curve (HPFC)
	\item Non-traded synthetic
	\item Useful for defining the value of a delivery contract
	\item Full supply contracts are always more valueable than profile supply
\end{itemize}
